# facedetection
Face detection in browser with JavaScript. In this project I am using face-app.js API to detect human faces and recognize it's expression (sad, angry, happy etc)

To start you need to have some simple http server, for example Live Server Extension for VS Code https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
